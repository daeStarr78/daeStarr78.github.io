## Personal Website Development

Welcome, readers.

This post pertains to the creation of my personal blog, the very website you are reading this from. In order to develop and document my skills, I've decided to create this blog. This process entailed programming, and I found that as an opportunity to grow my own skills. This website was created using Github Pages, Visual Studio Code, and the macOS Terminal app.

## What I've Learned:

* Homebrew is a powerful package manager for macOS and Linux that simplifies the installation, updating, and management of software and programming tools. It allows users to quickly install and manage libraries, frameworks, and development dependencies using simple commands, making it ideal for developers who need to set up or maintain their environments efficiently.

* Jekyll is a static site generator designed for creating fast and customizable websites or blogs. It uses Markdown or Liquid templates to transform plain text into static HTML, making it ideal for developers who want a lightweight solution for hosting content. Jekyll integrates seamlessly with platforms like GitHub Pages and supports plugins for added functionality, such as SEO, image optimization, or custom themes.

* Ruby is a dynamic, open-source programming language known for its simplicity and productivity. It emphasizes readability and developer-friendly syntax, making it ideal for web development, scripting, and data processing. Ruby powers frameworks like Rails and tools like Jekyll, and it has a rich ecosystem of libraries (gems) that extend its capabilities for various use cases.

* Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and GitHub work seamlessly together to streamline version control and collaboration. By linking a GitHub repository to VS Code, developers can clone, edit, and push changes directly from their editor. VS Code's built-in Git tools allow for easy commits, branch management, and conflict resolution.

## Problems I Faced:

* The tutorial was completed in the Windows operating system, so there were a few steps that required more intermediate steps as well as a few steps I managed to bypass completely.
