## Manifesto

What have I learned?

  As my age increases perpetually, I have realized that the amount of knowledge I harbor is a tiny fraction of the knowledge the entire world has to offer. Further, my knowledge is also a tiny fraction of the knowledge that Rutgers University has to offer. Finally, my knowledge is a tiny fraction of what I would need to succeed in my desired career.

  The more I learn, the more I realize that there are even more opportunities to learn. This is known as a positive feedback loop professionally, or a rabbit chase in casual conversation. For some reason, I enjoy this rabbit chase. Maybe it is because Iâ€™ve learned that life is not always transactional or quantifiable, and that I have to become somewhat obsessive in my career to compete with others and earn my spot. I am not guaranteed a career however becoming obsessive increases my chances. So in a way, by choosing to learn, by deciding to be a student at Rutgers, by chasing after the corporate life, I have signed a contract with myself to perpetually learn ad infinitum. I have no intention of breaching that contract.
