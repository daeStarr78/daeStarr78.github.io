## The Founder
I am Joshua Beckford, a Senior at [Rutgers University in New Brunswick](https://www.rutgers.edu/). I am majoring in [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) on the Statistics track and minor in Quantitative Economics.

In the Summer of 2024, I was a Financial Services Intern at [Hennion & Walsh](https://www.hennionandwalsh.com/). I have experience working at other large coporations, such as [Children's Specialized Hospital](https://www.rwjbh.org/childrens-specialized-hospital/) as a Security Officer. 

I consider myself well traveled, as I've been to 4 countries in Europe (United Kingdom, France, Italy, The Netherlands) and 3 countries in the Caribbean (Jamaica, Dominican Repbulic, Mexico). The differences in culture (and similarities) are my favorite things to observe while abroad.

In my free time, I go to the gym or watch anime. (I plan to explore both of those topics and many more via data analysis tools in the near future!)

I’m best reached through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshb1973/). I’m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
